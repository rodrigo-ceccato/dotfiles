# dotfiles
Here lies some dotfiles for:

* Terminator terminal
* i3-gaps
* i3blocks
* Tmux
* Screen
* Vim
* coc
* Compton
* ranger

I also packed a small script used for setting a video wallpaper using xwinwrap and mpv.

Added gitignore file that can be added globly with "git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore", after placed there.


## Thanks
